# Escape The Dungeon 
Final Project for HKU ENGG1340 Spring 2022

Group 83 </br>
Group Members: Davin Wu, Yeung Wong

# Introduction:
Turn-based game with cards. Player would control a prisoner in the dungeon, fighting against various monsters in order to escape from the dungeon. </br>
Players would initPlayer with 5 skill points, they can use them on either attack/defense/HP/, each skill point brings a benefit of +1. </br>

# Features
All actions in the game are controlled through text-based commands through `std::input`. All output from the program will be from `std::output`
- Dynamic memory management will be used when dealing with user input 

## Pathing
There are a total of 3 paths with the same number of stations, randomly generated by the program. Players should choose one of them to initPlayer the game. There are 4 types of station, shop/campfire/Opportunity/Monster, and the player is able to see what station it is in each Path.
- Data structure will be used to store the position of the player

## Battles
When stepping on a monster station, combat would be started. Players would draw 5 cards from the card library, and use them according to the card type. Those cards that havenâ€™t been used would be reorganized into the library. Each card has its own cost of spirit, players initPlayer with 3 spirit each round (if no skill point is added to it).
- Randomness in monster generation, rewards generation
- Data structure (inventory) will be utilized
- Game state (inventory) will be serialized to the disk incrementally
- Dynamic memory management to clean up game state after each battle has been completed

## Shop
Players can buy new cards
- Game state (inventory) will be serialized to the disk

## Campfire
One skill point is added and the player is able to reallocate their skill points here

## Random events
A random incident would be generated, different choices are provided and the player is able to choose one of them. Each one would have its pros and cons.
- Randomness in incident generation

## Quickstart
- make demo 
- run ./demo.o
Once the game has started, press the enter key to traverse the game.
You can type /help to get a list of commands which can be used

## Program process
- start (Background information, skill point allocation)
- Path generation, 3 lists with 10 nodes each
- Player moves along path
- Player run commands to perform actions at each path
- Player wins the game

## Program components
All files are under src
- demo.cpp (The entry point of the program)
- playerinfo.h (Includes the basic structs and classes for the player's data alongside methods needed to perform each path type)
  * Data structures
  * Randomness
- utils/game.h and game.cpp (Include the game client which controls the flow of the program)

- utils/battle.h battle.cpp (Includes stucts and a handler for battles)
- campfire.cpp (Let player decide if heal HP or allocate one more skill point)
- shop.cpp (Provide new cards that player can buy)
  * Randomness
- random_event.cpp (Provide a special effect to the player, either positive or negative)
- utils/database.h and database.cpp (Includes database functionality to save the state of the game)
  * Game state / io
